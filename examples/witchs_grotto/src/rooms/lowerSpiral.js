  `You're in a long, sloping corridor that curves gradually from an iron gate at the lower West end and up out of sight to the North East as it continues to spiral upwards. The walls and ceiling are built from roughly-hewn stone bricks of all shapes and sizes. The floor consists of large stone slabs worn smooth by passing feet over countless years.

Fixed to the walls at regular intervals are iron brackets holding burning torches that cast an unsteady orange illumination over the subterranean passageway. Irregular drafts of air cause the flames to flicker and gutter fitfully.`
