  "You're in a naturally-formed underground cavern. Around thirty feet across and vaguely egg-shaped, it's illuminated by sunlight slanting in through a narrow rock chimney in the roof. The stream that ran down the corridor you entered by joins a larger body of water lower down in the cave. By the edge of the water is an ancient-looking wooden dinghy."
