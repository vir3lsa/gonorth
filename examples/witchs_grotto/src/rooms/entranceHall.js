A large pair of oak double doors with a huge iron lock is set into the North wall and clearly serves as the main entrance. A moth-eaten but still rather beautiful rug lies in front of the doors, atop the dark floor boards. To one side of the door is a dead-looking tree limb that appears to function as a coat and hat stand. The witch's shaul isn't on it, but there's a black hat hanging on one of the branches. Against the wall opposite the door there's a beautiful mahogany sideboard.\n\nTo the South there's an archway leading to another corridor, whilst to the West is a sturdy door."
